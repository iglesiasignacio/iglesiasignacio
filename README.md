# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹   
I currently help people help each other at <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/" style="color: green;">GoFundMe</a> & <a href="https://www.classy.org/" style="color: blue;">Classy</a>!  
I was previously at <a href="https://www.asapp.com/" style="color: black;">ASAPP</a> where we solved challenging problems in NLP.  
I also worked some time in finance and earned a Ph.D. in heterogeneous catalysis.

Opinions and mistakes are my own.
